# Description:
This is a simplified version of the NIPS latex style that is suitable for preprint publication such as arXiv and bio-arXiv.
It is based on the nips_2018 style (can be found here: https://media.nips.cc/Conferences/NIPS2018/Styles/nips_2018.sty)


# Usage:
* Copy arxiv.sty to the folder containing your tex file.
* add \usepackage{arxiv} after \documentclass{article}.

See template.tex for a sample preprint article file.
