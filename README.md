# Description:
This is a simplified version of the NIPS latex style that is suitable for preprint publication such as arXiv and bio-arXiv.
It is based on the **nips_2018.sty style** (can be found here: https://media.nips.cc/Conferences/NIPS2018/Styles/nips_2018.sty)


# Usage:
1. Copy arxiv.sty to the folder containing your tex file.
2. add \usepackage{arxiv} after \documentclass{article}.

See template.tex for a sample preprint article file.

**The project files:**
1. **arxiv.sty** - the style file.
2. **template.tex** - the main template file.
3. **references.bib** - the bibliography source file.
