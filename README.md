## Description:

The project hosts an aesthetic an simple LaTeX style suitable for "preprint" publications such as arXiv and bio-arXiv, etc. It is based on the [**nips_2018.sty**](https://media.nips.cc/Conferences/NIPS2018/Styles/nips_2018.sty) style file. The goal of this style is to use to maintain the beautiful and comfortable styling of NIPS but to look fairly different from so that readers won't get confused to think that the preprint was published in NIPS. In addition, we will add features in our opinion missing in the NIPS styling.

### Why NIPS? 
Because the NIPS styling is a comfortable single column format that is very esthetic and convenient for reading.

## Usage:
1. Copy **arxiv.sty** to the folder containing your tex file.
2. add `\usepackage{arxiv}` after `\documentclass{article}`.
3. Do not use geometry package.

See **template.tex** 

## Project files:
1. **arxiv.sty** - the style file.
2. **template.tex** - a sample template that uses the **arxiv style**.
3. **references.bib** - the bibliography source file for template.tex.
4. **template.pdf** - a sample output of the template file that demonstrated the design provided by the arxiv style.
